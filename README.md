# BusyBee

BusyBee is a site-blocking browser extension designed to help you focus by snapping you out of mindless browsing when you get distracted.

BusyBee has two operating modes: Popup mode and Block mode. Popup mode opens a dialog box on blocked sites and, if the user proceeds, reopens after a certain amount of time. Block mode simply redirects the user to a blockpage. 

## Getting started

After downloading the repository to your computer, you can experiment with BusyBee in Chrome by navigating to `chrome://extensions`, and "Load Unpacked" the `BusyBee-chrome` folder. This will create a local installation of BusyBee in Chrome.

From there, you can edit the files in the `BusyBee-chrome` folder and reload the extension in Chrome to view the changes.
